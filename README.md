# A-College-Data-Set-Project
//Implemented two separate data structures (sorted array and hash table) 
//for two separate applications, to create randomly generated dataset of 3000 college students
//between the ages of 18-30, with randomized ID's. Project functionality includes search operations 
//for age and ID's, removal of a given age value and subsequently, all corresponding ID's, printing dataset, etc.
